# Master_Thesis_Pepijn_Hundepool
 This repository contains all source code related to the thesis: Synthetic Data-Driven Mismatch Detection for Updating BIM-Based Digital Twins from a Single Viewpoint.

 This project has leveraged the parametric dataset generator created by Pim van den Akker, see https://github.com/PimAkker/Final-Thesis-Pim-van-den-Akker, and the BLAINDER range scanner tool, see https://github.com/ln-12/blainder-range-scanner. Furthermore, the Bonsai extension was used to open IFC files inside Blender, see https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/bonsai/. The dataset generator requires Blender 3.6, while BLAINDER and Bonsai require Blender 4.2.
